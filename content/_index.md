## Welcome

I am an engineer, working in neuroscience research.
I love to make music and to dance (swing, balfolk, ..)

I often think about how to give scientists more insight into their own and others' code.

I am currently working on a PhD with [Mark Humphries](https://www.humphries-lab.org/).
Neuroscientists can film precise voltages of individual neurons in living animals.
We wonder how we can use such data to infer the wiring between neurons.
We could then construct connectomes _in vivo_.

You are welcome to read one of my [posts](/posts), or check out some
of the things I built under [projects](/projects).



## Scientific goal

I want to discover circuit-level mechanisms in higher-order brain areas.

Approach:

1. Take the ever-improving machine learning and data-analysis toolbox,
   and apply it to large scale activity recordings at the level of 
   individual cells to reveal robust patterns.

2. Build software models grounded in the literature, that make vague theories
   explicit, predict experimental data, and generate testable hypotheses.



## Education

I have a bachelor's in computer science and electrical engineering, and a 
master's in [biomedical engineering](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_51360389.htm),
both from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).

I took all graduate-level courses offered by the university in neuroscience 
([methods 101](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be//2017/syllabi/e/G0U76AE.htm),
[computation 101](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02B3AE.htm)),
and as many machine learning and data-analysis courses as would fit:

- [Bayesian & probabilistic graphical models](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02D2AE.htm),
- [Artificial neural networks](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H03V7BE.htm),
- [ML 101](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02C1AE.htm),
- [ML in practice](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H0T25AE.htm),
- [Multivariate & robust statistics](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/G0O00AE.htm),
- [Bio-informatics & more Bayesian modelling](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/H05M9AE.htm), and
- [Nonlinear systems](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/H0S11AE.htm).
