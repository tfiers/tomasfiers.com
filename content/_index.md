## Welcome

I am an engineer working in neuroscience research, 
where I apply maths and write software.
I love to make music and to dance (ðŸ’™ balfolk)

Questions I often wonder about: 
- What do tools look like that are maximally synergistic 
with the natural curiosity of kids and researchers?
- How can we make ideas as intuitive and simple to understand as possible?
Both when sharing our own ideas as when researching others'.
- What is good interface design?

I am currently working on a PhD with [Mark Humphries](https://www.humphries-lab.org/).
Neuroscientists can film precise voltages of individual neurons in living animals.
We wonder how we can use such data to infer the wiring between those neurons.
We could then construct connectomes _in vivo_.

You are welcome to read one of my [posts](/posts), or check out some
of the things I built under [projects](/projects).



## Education

I have a bachelor's in computer science and electrical engineering, and a 
master's in [biomedical engineering](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_51360389.htm) (specialization: signal processing),
both from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).

I did my [master's thesis](https://tomasfiers.net/projects/#masters-thesis-machine-learning-for-neuroscience-researchers) 
in a systems neuroscience [lab](https://www.nerf.be/research/nerf-labs/fabian-kloosterman), 
and filled my master's with [electives](https://tomasfiers.net/projects/#electives-i-took-in-my-masters) 
in data analysis, neuroscience, and machine learning.
