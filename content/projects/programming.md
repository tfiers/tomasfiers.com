I have been programming since I was 10. This has lead to a heap of hobby
projects, small and large. A selection of the ones I remember:

- Gravity & planetary motion simulator. The generated trajectories were pretty
  to look at. Programmed, as many other projects, in Flash / ActionScript (RIP
  this beautiful programming environment).
- [Weierstrass function](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Weierstrass_function)
  plotter. I was fascinated by this function that was continuous everywhere, but
  nowhere differentiable. With this app you could zoom in infinitely close on
  the function (or at least until the edge of numerical floating point
  precision).
- Fractal tree generator (including a clumsily animated giraffe roaming between
  the trees).
- [PID controller](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PID_controller) for a
  two-wheeled balancing robot (like a Segway) made with [Lego Mindstorms](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT).
- A chess AI. (Prototype in Python, final optimised code in C, using vectorized CPU instructions).
- A Scrabble AI (directly interfacing with the [Wordfeud](https://wordfeud.com/) API).
