About
----

Source for my personal website, [tomasfiers.net](https://tomasfiers.net).

- It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator; i.e. to convert Markdown files to HTML.
- The theme is [Hyde](https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/)
- The site is auto-built and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Many thanks to all three!
